# JukeBox
 A Python-based Shell-style audio player.
 Note: The install has not been rigorously tested. Likely much of it will fail at this point. Knowledge of python and programming is a requirement to both install and run this currently.
 
 ## Installation
Ensure that all of the following python packages and their dependencies are installed, as well as python 3.12.1:
	1. random
	2. os
	3. pygame
	4. time
	5. copy
	6. datetime
	7. json
	8. requests
	9. numpy
	10. mutagen
	11. matplotlib
	12. bs4
	13. tinytag
	
Download main.py and userInput.py. Set up a directory for your music files. Then run both python files. The program should prompt you to set up a username,  the path to your music directory, and the length of your output terminal window.
	
## Running the program
In a terminal shell, run "python \path\to\main.py & \path\to\userInput.py"
